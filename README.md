# professional-documents
Cybersecurity portfolio containing documents relating to experience and skills.

The Portfolio Documents folder contains activities provided by the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program that I have completed.

All of my answers are in italics to help them stand out. The folders listed as main - [name] contain Portfolio Activities, which show a variety of skills and strategies for handling different security scenarios. The other files contain activities that demonstrate one particular skill or idea, and are smaller in scope than the Portfolio Activities.
